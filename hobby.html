		<p> Let me introduce more about myself! I like surfing, edm, ballroom dancing and back packing! I believe that there is a difference between the pleasures of the moment (hedonia), and the satisfaction that comes from constantly developing and living one’s life to the fullest (eudaimonia). In recent years, scientists have finally begun to study eudaimonia. Research suggests that the greater sense of purpose and personal growth associated with eudaimonia correlates with lower cortisol levels, better immune function, and more efficient sleep.</p>

		<p> “Music is a way to express yourself, keep you company while you’re alone, and always give you something to do.”
			“Music is everything, without music there is no purpose to a lot of stuff.”
			“Music is a way to express yourself and your feelings. It’s something that I can go to whenever I need it.”
			“Music is a way to express feelings that might be hard to express otherwise.”
			I am learning how to make elecrontic music this semester! The piece of comprosition is coming soon. </p>
